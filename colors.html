    <h2>Colors</h2>
        <img id="hate" src="images/colors.png">
    <p>Colors are probably the most basic of any creation.<br> They have their own temperature, theme, and mood <br> that can be used to infinitely describe or emphasize<br> any material.<br><br>Inappropriate use of colors however can lead to unsuspenseful, but rather silly outcome. Colors are useful, yet very sensitive materials, and drawing in fear through colors must be done carefully.</p>
