    <p>(You build a salmon statue. It looks tasty that you might even start digging in...)</p>
    <h1>"Oh! What do we have here?"</h1>
    <p>(The giant eye appears above along with a giant mouth. The mouth beings to lick its lips as it notices the salmon statue.)</p>
    <h1>"I asked for a statue but you brought me a delicious looking salmon! I cannot resist!"</h1>
    <p>(The mouth swallows the statue in whole. Soon enough, it beings to choke.)</p>
    <h1 class="red">"KEK!"</h1>
    <p>(The eyeball and the mouth both falls flat on the ground. It has been defeated! You wait until something to happen...yet nothing happens. You find yourself forever stuck in your room. You have no choice but to spend your eternity in the empty, white room.)</p>

    <h1 class="teal">You have SURVIVED, yet you are stuck eternally stuck in a white, empty room. Congrats (not congrats)! :O</h1>
