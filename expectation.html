    <h2>Expectations</h2>

    <p>When you watch something, you often find yourself in anticipation of something to come. This is called expection; you expect it to come, and that draws in more fear because you know yourself the best what is about to happen. Knowing the future might give off an idea that fear is less, but actually in truth, the level of fear can be intensified exponentially.</p>
